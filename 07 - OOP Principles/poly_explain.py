#ex. len built in function - hadnle diff types of object

name = "Jim" # str
print(len(name))  #total characters

some_list = ["some","name"] # list - number of elements 
print(len(some_list))
# That's polymorphism in action, a single function(entity) does know
# how to handle different kinds of objects as expected!
