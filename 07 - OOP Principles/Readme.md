- Encapsulation
- Create read only attributes that set only at initilization and error if override is encapsulation            
- Encapsulation provides not direct access to attribute but modify attribute by method else error out if updated directly

- Polymorphism
- a single function(entity) does know how to handle different kinds of objects as expected!Ex. len(string) vs len(list)
- Single entity that can use multiple objects implemented using inheritance 
- Ex. single entity ex calculate_price from diff kind of objects for item, phone and keyboard class with disc_amt in classes using class attribute 

- methods called from send email only so hide access to these methods from instance level. Convert these methods as private methods by adding __ within class. So, then theses methods can be called by class level only - inside class.
