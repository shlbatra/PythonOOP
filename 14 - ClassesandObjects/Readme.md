- Classes (Blueprint for creating objects)
- Objects (Instance of class)
- x = 1 (int) -> type class int to create object
- y = "str" -> string
- class blueprint that defines functionality that object has
- z = 1+1 (int class has add functionality)
- z = 1+"str" (not acceptable as behavior not defined in class)
- object instance of class - can have multiple objects
- class 
    - has constructor defined by __init__
    - called everytime you create an object of that class
    - self -> refers to instance for which method called
    - attribute - data linked for object of class
    - methods -> behaviour of instances 
    - create instance 
        - dog = Dog("sahil",4,"person") -> by default constructor called
        - dog2 = Dog(..) -> seperate instance but both have same behaviors
        - dog.bark()
        - each instance has its own attributes. each object is individual
