- Python interpreter before reading a file
    - Sets special variables like __name__
    - Executes the file line by line
- Diff design pattern 
    - File run directly as program (Main Execution File) -> __name__ = __main__
    - File run as a module from another file -> __name__ != __main__ 
- Even if specific method/attribute imported from module, the entire module is run
