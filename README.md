The Original Code repository for my Python OOP Series

1. Encapsulation - mechanism of restricting direct access to some attributes in program, restrict ability to override values for your objects 
withon saddles 
2. Abstraction - show necessary attributes and hides unnecessary info, hide unnecessary details from users - who use that class.,
3. Inheritance - mechanism to reuse code across classes.parent-child classes 
4. Polymorphism - Use of single type entity to represent diff types in diff scenarios,  many forms,  ex. Built in Python function, ability to have diff scenarios when we call the exact same entity ex. function. implemented using Abstract classes.
Interface way a class should be designed, template for a class achieved by abstract classes.
